The Truman Platform 
=======================

Named after the 1998 film, The Truman Show, **the Truman Platform** is a social media simulation platform created by [The Cornell Social Media Lab](https://socialmedialab.cornell.edu/) to provide researchers a community research infrastructure to conduct social media experiments in ecologically-valid realistic environments. Researchers can create different social media environments with a repertoire of features and affordances that fit their research goals and purposes, while ensuring participants have a naturalistic social media experience. 

This current iteration studies the **effect of online community members behavior on audiences behavior, perception, and future behavioral intentions**.
